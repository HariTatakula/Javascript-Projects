Regular expressions are special sequences of characters that describe a pattern of text that is to be matched
We can use literals to match the exact characters that we desire
Alternation, using the pipe symbol |, allows us to match the text preceding or following the |
Character sets, denoted by a pair of brackets [], let us match one character from a series of characters
Wildcards, represented by the period or dot ., will match any single character (letter, number, symbol or whitespace)
Ranges allow us to specify a range of characters in which we can make a match
Shorthand character classes like \w, \d and \s represent the ranges representing word characters, digit characters, and whitespace characters, respectively
Groupings, denoted with parentheses (), group parts of a regular expression together, and allows us to limit alternation to part of a regex
Fixed quantifiers, represented with curly braces {}, let us indicate the exact quantity or a range of quantity of a character we wish to match
Optional quantifiers, indicated by the question mark ?, allow us to indicate a character in a regex is optional, or can appear either 0 times or 1 time
The Kleene star, denoted with the asterisk *, is a quantifier that matches the preceding character 0 or more times
The Kleene plus, denoted by the plus +, matches the preceding character 1 or more times
The anchor symbols hat ^ and dollar sign $ are used to match text at the start and end of a string, respectively
